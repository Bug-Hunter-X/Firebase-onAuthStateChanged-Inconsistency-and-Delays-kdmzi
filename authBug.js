The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's session is abruptly terminated due to a network issue or the app being forcefully closed.  This can lead to the app remaining in an inconsistent state, where it believes a user is authenticated even though they're not.  Additionally, the listener might not fire immediately upon successful authentication, leading to a delay in accessing user data or features.
