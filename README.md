# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential inconsistency and delay in the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The listener may fail to trigger under certain conditions, such as abrupt session termination due to network issues or app closure.  This can result in an inconsistent application state where the app incorrectly believes a user is authenticated.

The `authBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `authBugSolution.js` offers a potential solution involving a combination of persistent state management and a retry mechanism.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Initialize Firebase according to the Firebase documentation.
3.  Run `authBug.js`. Observe the behavior when the network connection is interrupted during authentication or the app is forcibly closed.

## Solution

The `authBugSolution.js` file presents a solution that addresses the listener's inconsistencies by implementing a combination of techniques.  Refer to the code comments within the file for detailed explanations.
